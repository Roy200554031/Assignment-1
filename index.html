        <h3>Lyrics</h3>
        <pre>
            [Intro: The Weeknd]
            Na-na-na-na, na-na
            Na-na-na-na, oh no
            Yeah, yeah
            
            [Chorus: The Weeknd & Post Malone]
            Said you love me, but I don't care
            That I broke my hand on the same wall
            That you told me that he fucked you on (Oh)
            You think it's so easy fuckin' with my feelings
            I got one comin' over and one right now (Uh)
            One right now
            (One right now, one right now, oh)
            I got one comin' over and one right now
            
            [Verse 1: Post Malone]
            Said you wanna have my babies
            I fucked you so good, you should pay me
            Don't call me "baby" when you did me so wrong
            (When you did me so wrong)
            But I got over what you did already
            Body for a body, I’m so petty
            How many of your friends fit in my Rolls? (Can you fit in my Rolls?)
            Bought you a new face, you should call me "Dad," baby
            Hermès, but you dropped the bag, baby
            Truth is, maybe one's just not еnough

            [Chorus: Post Malone & The Weeknd]
            You say you love me, but I don't care
            That I brokе my hand on the same wall
            That you told me that he fucked you on (That he fucked you on)
            You think it's so easy fuckin' with my feelings (Feelings)
            I got one comin' over and one right now (Uh)
            One right now (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
            (One right now, one right now, oh yeah)
            I got one comin' over and one right now (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
            (One right now, one right now, oh)
            I got one comin' over and one right now
            
            [Verse 2: The Weeknd]
            You're a stain on my legacy
            We can't be friends, can't be family (Oh)
            You probably fuck all my enemies (Oh)
            I can't let you be next to me
            Oh, you belong to the world now
            So just leave me alone now
            We're not in touch no more
            
            [Chorus: Post Malone & The Weeknd, Post Malone, The Weeknd]
            You say you love me, but I don't care (No, I don't care)
            That I broke my hand on the same wall
            That you told me that he fucked you on (Oh)
            You think it's so easy fuckin' with my feelings (Feelings)
            I got one comin' over and one right now
            One right now (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
            (Fuckin' with my, fuckin' with my feelings)
            I got one comin' over and one right now
            (Ooh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
            (One right now)
            I got one comin' over and one right now
            [Outro: Post Malone & The Weeknd, Post Malone, The Weeknd]
            (Hey)
            (One right now, one right now)
            (Ooh yeah)
            I got one comin' over and one right now
